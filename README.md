Node Music Sync for Android
=======================

A syncing application for Android to sync playlists from Node Music Player https://github.com/benkaiser/node-music-player

Currently very much a work in progress, however I aim to implement it as so:

- You enter the url of the server you want to fetch playlists from
- The app then then pulls the songs down to the device and adds them to the content resolver
- It also adds the playlists to the content resolver so that other apps can use them
- Use a seperate music player of your choice that uses device playlists to play your music

Music Player Examples:

- Vanilla Music: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.blinkenlights.android.vanilla
- Music Player Free: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yong.app.music

Got an Open Source Media Player for Android and want yours listed? submit [an issue](https://github.com/benkaiser/android-node-music-sync/issues/new)!
